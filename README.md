# tsneNHL

This project is an exploration of the T-SNE methodology as a way to cluster NHL players.  The idea is to use T-SNE's dimensionality reducing qualities to leverage a large number of player-specific variables, ultimately creating a visualization that clusters similar players together.   

I know clustering is sort of "been there, done that", but I haven't seen a lot of good visualizations of multimensional space (see any R-based k-means visualization).  

I don't think this is a good start for an app (I don't think there are enough useful variations in the model - they will require more careful tuning).  Instead, the output will probably be a markdown file explaining the model/methodology/graphic.  Maybe an infographic?
